Partial analysis code from the drug re-positioning project

GWAS stands for genome-wide association studies. It is the study of many genetic variants in different individuals to see if any variant is associated with a trait.
Our drug repositioning method using GWAS is based on the paper “Use of genome-wide association studies for drug repositioning”, though not all steps are included.

However, since Pharmaprojects are not available for us, instead of utilizing Pharmaprojects to obtain information of active drug projects, we used DGIdb and ClinicalTrials. DGIdb is a drug-gene interaction database that gives us the corresponding drugs for each gene. Then ClinicalTrials is used to provide the information of potential drugs.
